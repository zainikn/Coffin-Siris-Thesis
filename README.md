# Computational Study on Coffin-Siris Syndrome: Genetic Variant Analysis

This repository hosts my independently conducted genetic research thesis:

**"A Study on Coffin-Siris Syndrome – Computational Analysis of Its Genetic Variants"**

---

## Abstract

This thesis explores the **pathogenic impact of genetic variants associated with Coffin-Siris Syndrome**, a rare developmental disorder. Using in-silico bioinformatics tools, this project analyzes mutations in genes such as **SOX11, SMARCA4, SMARCC2, DPF2, and BICRA**, predicting their role in the syndrome's phenotypic outcomes.
